The HR department for Acora has asked for a new application to store and display employee details. 
They have asked for the following functionality:
1)	Display a list of employees and allow them to sort by name and employee Id.
2)	A facility to add / update / delete an employee.
3)	We need validations when adding/ updating employee details: 
a.	Employee age is between 18 and 65.
b.	FirstName and last name are mandatory.
c.	A department must be chosen.
The following details have to be captured, a sample schema provided below:

FirstName	nvarchar(50)
LastName	nvarchar(50)
Address	nvarchar(100)
City	nvarchar(50)
	
Department

You have approximately 60 minutes to complete this test. It does not matter if all functionality is completed or not, we want to see your approach to this test and your coding style.
